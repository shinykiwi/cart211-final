## CART-211: Creative Computing and Network Culture
### **Course Description:** 
*This course gives a broad introduction to the fundamentals of creative computing and network culture. Through readings and practical examples, students explore the histories of the Internet, computing and interactivity, as well as gain knowledge of fundamental technical tools used for creating network-based media. This is a multi-disciplinary course about the history of the internet, its impact on society and culture, and the role of the artist or designer within it. In this course you will design and create websites as well as study the theory that will help you make sense of what you are doing and why.* 

### **Final Project Assignment:**
*Students will develop an original website that demonstrates the skills and techniques learned in this course. It should feature an engaging design and express an original idea or statement that critically engages with or intervenes into network culture.*

### **Project Description:**
I designed a website to showcase several important artists of the 1930s-40s time period, with the goal of positioning their work in context with world events at the time. Music is often inspired by the world around us. Especially in the case of art in history, before we can understand why or how a piece came to be, it is important to understand the context of its conception so that we can better understand its motive and meaning. Therefore, alongside information about the artist, their song, lyrics etc, I placed real world articles in a newspaper-like format from the year the song was released. This way, the viewer can briefly contextualize the piece in it's time period, and imagine the artist creating it while living through the events of the 30s and 40s.
